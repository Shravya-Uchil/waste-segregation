# Intelligent waste segregation using Machine Learning.

## Read me for image generator code:
Run this code from dataset-resized\dataset-resized folder, i.e., the folder containing cardboard, glass, metal, etc ... folders.
The code will generate augmented images in gray scale. Images will be generated in cardboard_aug, glass_aug, ... folders.
Modify loopsize to generate more data if needed.
This needs to be run only once on each machine.
Note: Code is still crude and needs to be optimized.
